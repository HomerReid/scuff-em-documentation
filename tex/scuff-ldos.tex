\section{Homogeneous Green's functions}

Before doing anything we recall our notation and conventions
for dyadic Green's functions.
In a homogeneous material region with relative permittivity
and permeability $\{\epsilon^r, \mu^r\}$, electric and magnetic
volume currents $\vb J, \vb M$ give rise to electric and magnetic
fields $\vb E, \vb H$ according to 
$$
\left\{\begin{array}{c} E_i(\vb x) \\[5pt] H_i(\vb x) \end{array}\right\}
=
\int
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
 \Gamma_{ij}\supt{EE}(\vb x, \vb x^\prime) &
 \Gamma_{ij}\supt{EM}(\vb x, \vb x^\prime) \\[5pt]
 \Gamma_{ij}\supt{ME}(\vb x, \vb x^\prime) &
 \Gamma_{ij}\supt{MM}(\vb x, \vb x^\prime)
\end{array}\right)
\left(\begin{array}{c} J_i(\vb x) \\[5pt] M_i(\vb x) \end{array}\right)

$$
where
%====================================================================%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
 \vbGamma\supt{EE} &= ikZ_0 Z^r \mb G \\
 \vbGamma\supt{EM} &= ik        \mb C \\
 \vbGamma\supt{ME} &= -ik       \mb C \\
 \vbGamma\supt{MM} &= \frac{ik}{Z_0 Z^r} \mb G
\end{align}
\label{GammaFromGC}
\end{subequations}
%====================================================================%
where $k=\sqrt{\epsilon^r \mu^r}\cdot \omega$
is the photon wavenumber in the medium, 
$Z^r=\sqrt\frac{\mu^r}{\epsilon^r}$ is the dimensionless relative
wave impedance,
$Z_0\approx 377\,\Omega$ is the impedance of free space, and
the $\mb G$ and $\mb C$ tensors are
%====================================================================%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\mb G_{ij}(k,\vb r) 
 &= \frac{e^{ikr}}{4\pi (ik)^2 r^3}
    \bigg[ \Big(1-ikr + (ikr)^2 \Big)\delta_{ij}
          +\Big(-3 + 3ikr - (ikr)^2 \Big)\frac{r_i r_j}{r^2}
    \bigg]
\\
\mb C_{ij}(k,\vb r) 
 &= \frac{e^{ikr}}{4\pi (ik) r^3} \varepsilon_{ijk} r_k.

\section{Scattering Green's functions and LDOS in the non-periodic case}

In the presence of scatterers, the scattering parts of the electric
and magnetic dyadic Green's functions (DGFs) are
%====================================================================%
\begin{align*}
 \mc G_{ij}\supt{E}(\omega; \vb x, \vb x^\prime)
   \equiv
   \frac{1}{ikZ_0 Z^r}
  &\left( \parbox{0.65\textwidth}
    { $i$-component of scattered $\vb E$-field at $\vb x$
      due to a unit-strength $j$-directed point \textbf{electric} 
      dipole radiator
      at $\vb x^\prime$, all quantities having time dependence
      $\sim e^{-i\omega t}$
    }
   \right)
\\[5pt]
%%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
 \mc G_{ij}\supt{M}(\omega; \vb x, \vb x^\prime)
   \equiv
   \frac{Z_0 Z^r}{ik}
  &\left( \parbox{0.65\textwidth}
    { $i$-component of scattered $\vb H$-field at $\vb x$
      due to a unit-strength $j$-directed point \textbf{magnetic}
      dipole radiator
      at $\vb x^\prime$, all quantities having time dependence
      $\sim e^{-i\omega t}$
    }
   \right)
\end{align*}
%====================================================================%
Note that the prefactors in the definitions here are the reciprocals
of those in (\ref{GammaFromGC}a,d), and that
$\bmc G\supt{E,M}$ both have dimensions of inverse
length.

The enhancement of the local density of states (LDOS)
at frequency $\omega$ and at a point $\vb x$ in a 
scattering geometry is related to the scattering DGFs according 
to\footnote{K Joulain et al.,``Definition and measurement of the local 
density of electromagnetic states close to an interface,''
Physical Review B \textbf{68} 245405 (2003)}
%====================================================================%
$$
   \texttt{LDOS}(\omega; \vb x)
   \equiv 
   \frac{\rho(\omega; \vb x)}{\rho_0(\omega)}
   \equiv 
   \frac{\pi}{k_0^2}\text{Tr }\text{Im }
   \Big[ \bmc G\supt{E}(\omega; \vb x, \vb x)
        +\bmc G\supt{M}(\omega; \vb x, \vb x)
   \Big]
$$
%====================================================================%
where $\rho_0(\omega)\equiv k^3_0/(\pi c)$ is the free-space
LDOS and $k_0=\omega/c$ is the free-space wavenumber at the
frequency in question.

In {\sc scuff-em} the dyadic GFs may be computed easily by solving a
scattering problem in which the incident fields arise from a point dipole
radiator at a source point $\vb x\subt{S}$.
For example, to compute $\mc G\supt{E}$ we take the incident fields 
to be the fields of a unit-strength $j$-directed point electric dipole 
source at $\vb s\supt{S}$:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\numeq{EHED}
{
 \vb E\sups{inc}(\vb x) =
 \vb E\supt{ED}\Big(\vb x; \{\vb x\subt{S}, \vbhat{x}_j\} \Big),
 \qquad
 \vb H\sups{inc}(\vb x) =
 \vb H\supt{ED}\Big(\vb x; \{\vb x\subt{S}, \vbhat{x}_j\} \Big)
}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $\{\vb E, \vb H\}\supt{ED}\Big(\vb x; \{\vb x_0, \vb p_0\}\Big)$
are the fields of a point electric dipole radiator 
at $\vb x_0$ with dipole moment $\vb p_0$. 
(Expressions for these fields are given in 
Appendix \ref{DipoleFieldsAppendix}).
Then we simply solve an ordinary {\sc scuff-em} scattering
problem with the incident fields given by equation 
(\ref{EHED}) and compute the scattered---not total!---fields
at the evaluation point $\vb x\subt{D}$. The three components of the
$\vb E$-field at $\vb x\subt{D}$, divided by $ikZ_0 Z_r$, yield the
three vertical entries of the $j$th column of the
$3\times 3$ matrix 
$\bmc G\sups{E}(\omega; \vb x\subt{D}, \vb x\subt{S}.)$
Calculating $\bmc G\sups{M}$ is similar except that we use 
a point magnetic source to supply the incident field 
and compute the scattered $\vb H$ field instead of the 
scattered $\vb E$ field.

\section{Extension to the periodic case}

In the Bloch-periodic module of {\sc scuff-em}, \textit{all}
fields and currents are assumed to be Bloch-periodic, i.e.
if $Q(\vb x)$ denotes any field or current component at $\vb x$,
then we have the built-in assumption
%====================================================================%
\numeq{BlochCondition}
{Q(\vb x + \vb L) = e^{i\vb k\subt{B} \cdot \vb L}Q(\vb x)}
%====================================================================%
where $\vb L$ is any lattice vector and 
$\vb k\subt{B}$ is the Bloch wavevector.

The fields of a point dipole, equation (\ref{EHED}), do \textit{not}
satisfy (\ref{BlochCondition}), and hence may not be used in
Bloch-periodic {\sc scuff-em} calculations. Instead, what we can 
simulate in the periodic case are the fields of an infinite
phased \textit{array} of point electric dipoles,
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
 \vb E\supt{EDA}\Big(\vb x; \{ \vb x_0, \vb p_0, \vb k\subt{B}\}\Big)
&=\sum_{\vb L} e^{i\vb k\subt{B}\cdot \vb L}
  \, \vb E\supt{ED}\Big(\vb x; \{\vb x\subt{0}+\vb L, \vb p_0\} \Big),
\\
 \vb H\supt{EDA}\Big(\vb x; \{ \vb x_0, \vb p_0, \vb k\subt{B}\}\Big)
&=\sum_{\vb L} e^{i\vb k\subt{B}\cdot \vb L}
  \, \vb H\supt{ED}\Big(\vb x; \{\vb x\subt{0}+\vb L, \vb p_0\} \Big),
\end{align}
\label{EHEDA}
\end{subequations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
(where ``EDA'' stands for ``electric dipole array''). The quantities
we can compute in a single {\sc scuff-em} scattering calculation
are now the periodically phased versions of the DGFs, i.e.
(suppressing $\omega$ arguments),
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\numeq{ScriptGBarDef}
{
 \overline{\mc G_{ij}\supt{E}}(\vb x, \vb x^\prime, \vb k\subt{B})
 \equiv \sum_{\vb L} e^{i\vb k\subt{B}\cdot \vb L}
  \mc G_{ij}\supt{E}(\vb x, \vb x^\prime+\vb L), 
}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
with $\overline{\mc G_{ij}\supt{M}}$ defined similarly.
(Here and elsewhere, barred symbols denote Bloch-periodic 
quantities.) To recover the non-periodic Green's function---that
is, the response of our periodic geometry to a \textit{non-periodic}
point source---we must perform a Brillouin-zone 
integration:\footnote{To derive these equations, multiply both sides
of (\ref{ScriptGBarDef}) by $e^{-i\vb k\subt{B} \cdot \vb L^\prime}$,
integrate both sides over the Brillouin zone, and use the
condition 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
$$\int\subt{BZ} e^{i\vb k\subt{B}\cdot (\vb L-\vb L^\prime)}\,d\vb k
  =\mc{V}\subt{BZ} \, \delta(\vb L,\vb L^\prime)
$$
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $\mc V\subt{BZ}$ is the Brillouin-zone volume [for example,
a square lattice with basis vectors
$\{\vb L_1, \vb L_2\}=\{L_x\vbhat{x}, L_y\vbhat{y}\}$ has
$\mc V\subt{BZ}=4\pi^2/(L_x L_y)$].
Setting $\vb L^\prime=0$ recovers (\ref{BZIntegration}).}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\numeq{BZIntegration}
{
  \mc G_{ij}\supt{E}(\vb x, \vb x^\prime)
 =\frac{1}{\mc V\subt{BZ}} 
   \int\subt{BZ} 
   \overline{\mc G_{ij}\supt{E}}(\vb x, \vb x^\prime, \vb k\subt{B})
   \, d\vb k\subt{B}
}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
and similarly for $\mc G\supt{M}.$

\subsection*{Evaluation of BZ integrals}

The {\sc scuff-em} API offers a routine for computing the integrand of
(\ref{BZIntegration}) for given evaluation and source points
$\vb x, \vb x^\prime$ and Bloch vector $\vb k\subt{B}$. To get the 
full Green's function on the LHS requires a numerical cubature
over the Brillouin zone.

For a 2D square lattice with lattice vectors 
$\vb L_1=L_x\vbhat{x}, \vb L_2=L_y\vbhat{x},$
a set of reciprocal-lattice basis vectors is 
$\vbGamma_1=\pf{2\pi}{L_x} \vbhat{x},
 \vbGamma_2=\pf{2\pi}{L_y} \vbhat{y}$,
and Brillouin-zone integrals take the form
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
$$ \frac{1}{\mc V\subt{BZ}} 
   \int\subt{BZ} f(\vb k\subs{B}) \, d \vb k\subt{B}
  =4\int_0^{1/2} \, d u_1 \, \int_0^{1/2} \, d u_2 \, 
   f\Big( u_1\vbGamma_1 + u_2\vbGamma_2 \Big)
$$

\section{Vector-Matrix-Vector product formula for dyadic Green's functions}

In the discretized BEM framework we can write convenient
vector-matrix-vector product formulas for the scattering parts
of the electric and magnetic DGFs.

\subsection*{VMVP formula for $\bmc G\supt{E}$}

Consider first the electric DGF
$\bmc G\supt{E}_{ij}(\vb x\subt{D}, \vb x\subt{S})$,
where the subscripts stand for ``destination'' and ``source.''
To get at this, we must solve a scattering problem in which 
the incident fields are the fields radiated by a 
$j$-directed point dipole source $\vb p=p_0\vbhat{n}_j$
at $\vb x\subt{S}$:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\numeq{VMVEHInc}
{
 \left\{\begin{array}{c}
 E_\ell\sups{inc}(\vb x) \\[8pt] 
 H_\ell\sups{inc}(\vb x)
 \end{array}\right\}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
= -i\omega p_0
  \left\{\begin{array}{c}
   \Gamma_{\ell j}\supt{EE}(\vb x, \vb x\subt{S}) \\[8pt]
   \Gamma_{\ell j}\supt{ME}(\vb x, \vb x\subt{S})
  \end{array}\right\}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
= (-i\omega p_0)
  \left\{\begin{array}{r}
  ik Z_0 Z^r\mb G_{\ell j}(\vb x, \vb x\subt{S}) 
   \\[8pt]
   -ik\mb C_{\ell j}(\vb x, \vb x\subt{S})
  \end{array}\right\}
}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The scattered electric field
at $\vb x\subt{D}$ is obtained from the surface currents
$\vb K, \vb N$ according to 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align}
 E_i\sups{scat}(\vb x\subt{D})
%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
&=\int 
  \left\{\begin{array}{c}
   \Gamma_{i \ell}\supt{EE}(\vb x\subt{D}, \vb x) 
   \\[8pt]
   \Gamma_{i \ell}\supt{EM}(\vb x\subt{D}, \vb x) 
  \end{array}\right\}^T
  \left\{\begin{array}{c}
   K_\ell(\vb x) 
   \\[8pt]
   N_\ell(\vb x)
  \end{array}\right\}
  \, d\vb x
\\
%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
&= 
  \int 
  \left\{\begin{array}{r}
  ikZ_0 Z^r\mb G_{i \ell}(\vb x\subt{D}, \vb x)

  \end{array}\right\}^T
  \left\{\begin{array}{r}
K_\ell(\vb x)
   \\[8pt]
N_\ell(\vb x) 
  \end{array}\right\}
  \, d\vb x 
\intertext{Insert the expansions
           $\vb K(\vb x)=\sum k_a \vb b_a(\vb x)$, 
           $\vb N(\vb x)=-Z_0 \sum n_a \vb b_a(\vb x)$:}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
&= \sum_{a}
  \left\{\begin{array}{r}
  ikZ_0 Z^r g_a(\vb x\subt{D}, \vbhat{n}_i)
   \\[8pt]
  -ikZ_0 c_a(\vb{x}\subt{D}, \vbhat{n}_i)
  \end{array}\right\}^T
  \left\{\begin{array}{r}
   k_a 
   \\[8pt]
   n_a
  \end{array}\right\}
\label{EScatKN}
\end{align}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where I defined
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
  g_a(\vb{x}\subt{D}, \vbhat{n}_i)
\equiv \int \mb G_{i \ell}(\vb x\subt{D}, \vb x) b_{a\ell}(\vb x) \, d\vb x,
  \qquad
  c_a(\vb{x}\subt{D}, \vbhat{n}_i)
\equiv\int \mb C_{i \ell}(\vb x\subt{D}, \vb x) b_{a\ell}(\vb x) \, d\vb x.
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The surface-current expansion coefficients are obtained by solving
the BEM system:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\numeq{VMVBEMSystem}
{
 \left(\begin{array}{c} k_a \\ n_a\end{array}\right)
= -W_{ab} \left(\begin{array}{l} e_b \\ h_b\end{array}\right).
}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Here $\vb W$ is the inverse BEM matrix and $e_b, h_b$ are the 
projections of the incident field onto the basis functions:
%====================================================================%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
 e_b 
&\equiv \frac{1}{Z_0} \Inp{\vb b_m}{\vb E\sups{inc}}
 = (-i\omega p_0)(ikZ^r)
  \underbrace{\int b_{b\ell}(\vb x) \mb G_{\ell j}(\vb x, \vb x\subt{S}) \,dx}
            _{g_{b}(\vb x\subt{S}, \vbhat{n}_j)}
\nn
&= (-i\omega p_0)(ikZ^r) g_b(\vb x\subt{S}, \vbhat{n}_j)
\\[6pt]
 h_b 
&\equiv \hphantom{\frac{1}{Z_0}} \Inp{\vb b_m}{\vb H\sups{inc}}
 =(-i\omega p_0)(ik) 
  \underbrace{\left[-\int b_{b\ell}(\vb x) 
                  \mb C_{\ell j}(\vb x, \vb x\subt{S}) \,dx\right] 
             }_{-c_b(\vb x\subs{s}, \vbhat{n}_j)}
\nn
&= -(-i\omega p_0)(ik) c_b(\vb x\subt{S}, \vbhat{n}_j). 
\end{align}
\label{ebhb}%
\end{subequations}
Note that the $g_b,c_b$ quantities are the same as the $g_a, c_a$
computed above; this follows from reciprocity,
$\mb O_{ij}(\vb x, \vb y)=\mb O_{ji}(\vb y, \vb x)$
 for $\mb O=\{\mb G, \mb C\}$.

Inserting (\ref{VMVBEMSystem}) and (\ref{ebhb}) into
(\ref{EScatKN}), the scattered field at $x\subt{D}$
takes the form of a vector-matrix-vector product,
%====================================================================%
\begin{align}
  \left\{\begin{array}{c}
 E_i\sups{scat}(\vb x\subt{D}) \\[8pt]
 H_i\sups{scat}(\vb x\subt{D})
 \end{array}\right\}
&=(i\omega p_0) \cdot \frac{1}{Z_0}
  \underbrace{
  \left\{\begin{array}{c}
     ikZ_0 Z^r
     g_a(\vb x\subt{D}, \vbhat{n}_i) \\[4pt]
    -ikZ_0 c_a(\vb x\subt{D}, \vbhat{n}_i) 
  \end{array}\right\}^T
             }_{\equiv (\vb r\supt{E}\iD)_a}
  \left(
 \vphantom{
  \left\{\begin{array}{c} 
    ik Z_0 Z^r
     g_a(\vb x\subt{D}, \vbhat{n}_i) \\[4pt]
    -ikZ_0 c_a(\vb x\subt{D}, \vbhat{n}_i) 
  \end{array}\right\}^T
          }
         W_{ab}
  \right)
  \underbrace{

  \end{array}\right\}
             }_{\equiv (\vb r\supt{E}\jS)_b}
\label{GEVMVP}
\end{align}
and the scattering part of the electric DGF reads
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\numeq{GijEVMVP}
{
 \mc G_{ij}\supt{E}(\vb x\subt{D}, \vb x\subt{S})
= \frac{E_i\sups{scat}}{(ikZ_0 Z^r)(-i\omega p_0)}
= -\frac{1}{ikZ_0^2 Z^r}
   \Big( \vb r\iD\supt{E} \cdot \vb W \cdot \vb r\jS\supt{E} \Big)
}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
I think of the vectors $\vb r\supt{E}\iD$ and $\vb r\supt{E}\jS$ 
as ``reduced-field'' vectors; their dot product with a vector
of surface-current coefficients yields the $i,j$ components of 
the scattered electric fields at $x\supt{D,S}$.

\subsection*{VMVP formula for $\bmc G\supt{M}$}

Computing the magnetic Green's function entails the following
modifications:
\begin{itemize}
 \item The incident fields now arise from a point magnetic source
       of strength $m_0$. This changes equation (\ref{VMVEHInc})
       to read
%====================================================================%
$$
 \left\{\begin{array}{c}
 E_\ell\sups{inc}(\vb x) \\[8pt]
 H_\ell\sups{inc}(\vb x)
 \end{array}\right\}
= -i\omega m_0
  \left\{\begin{array}{r}
   \Gamma_{\ell j}\supt{EM}(\vb x, \vb x\subt{S}) \\[8pt]
   \Gamma_{\ell j}\supt{MM}(\vb x, \vb x\subt{S})
  \end{array}\right\}
= (-i\omega m_0)
  \left\{\begin{array}{r}
     ik \mb C_{\ell j}(\vb x, \vb x\subt{S}) \\[8pt]
  \frac{ik}{Z_0 Z^r} \mb G_{\ell j}(\vb x, \vb x\subt{S})
  \end{array}\right\}
$$
%====================================================================%
 \item The quantity I want to compute is the scattered magnetic
       field. This replaces equation (\ref{EScatKN}) with
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align}
 H_i\sups{scat}(\vb x\subt{D})
%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
&=\int 
  \left\{\begin{array}{c}
   \Gamma_{i \ell}\supt{ME}(\vb x\subt{D}, \vb x) 
   \\[8pt]
   \Gamma_{i \ell}\supt{MM}(\vb x\subt{D}, \vb x) 
  \end{array}\right\}^T
  \left\{\begin{array}{c}
   K_\ell(\vb x) 
   \\[8pt]
   N_\ell(\vb x)
  \end{array}\right\}
  \, d\vb x
\\
%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
&= \sum_{a}
  \left\{\begin{array}{r}
  -ik c_a(\vb {x}\subt{D}, \vbhat{n}_i)
   \\[8pt]
  -\frac{ik}{Z^r} g_a(\vb {x}\subt{D}, \vbhat{n}_i)
  \end{array}\right\}^T
  \left\{\begin{array}{r}
   k_a 
   \\[8pt]
   n_a
  \end{array}\right\}
\label{HScatKN}
\end{align}
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The expression analogous to (\ref{GEVMVP}) for the scattered
magnetic field due to a magnetic source then reads
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
 H\sups{scat}_i
&=+\frac{1}{Z_0}
  \underbrace{
  \left(\begin{array}{c} 
   -ik c_a(\vb x\subt{D}, \vbhat{n}_i)  \\[4pt]
   -\frac{1}{ik Z^r}  g_a(\vb x\subt{D}, \vbhat{n}_i)
  \end{array}\right)^T
             }_{\equiv (\vb r\supt{H}\iD)_a}
%%====================================================================%
  \left(
 \vphantom{
  \left\{\begin{array}{c}

  \end{array}\right\}^T
          }
         W_{ab}
  \right)
%====================================================================%
  \underbrace{
  \left(\begin{array}{c} 
   -ik  c_b(\vb x\subt{S}, \vbhat{n}_j)  \\[4pt]

  \end{array}\right)
             }_{\equiv (\vb r\supt{H}\jS)_b}
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
so the scattering part of the magnetic DGF reads

\section{Fields of a phased array of point dipole radiators}
\label{DipoleFieldsAppendix}

To compute dyadic Green's functions in periodic geometries,
{\sc scuff-ldos} solves a scattering problem in which the
incident fields originate from a an infinite phased array
of point sources. Here I describe the calculation of these
infinite fields. This calculation is implemented by the 
\texttt{PointSource} 
class in the {\sc libincfield} module in {\sc scuff-em}.

\subsection*{Fields of a single point dipole}

First consider a single point electric dipole radiator (not an array)
with dipole moment $\vb p_0$ at a point $\vb x_0$ in a
medium with relative permittivity and permeability
$\epsilon^r, \mu^r$
(as usual suppressing time-dependence factors
of $e^{-i\omega t}$). The fields at $\vb x$ due to this source are 
%====================================================================%
\begin{align*}
  \vb E\supt{ED}(\vb x; \vb x_0, \vb p_0)
   &= \frac{|\vb p_0|}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon^r}
      \cdot \frac{e^{ikr}}{4\pi r^3} \cdot 
      \Big[ f_1(ikr) \vbhat{p_0} + f_2(ikr)(\vbhat{r}\cdot \vbhat{p_0})\vbhat{r} \Big]
\\
  \vb H\supt{ED}(\vb x; \vb x_0, \vb p_0)
   &= \frac{1}{Z_0 Z^r }\cdot \frac{|\vb p_0|}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon^r}
      \cdot \frac{e^{ikr}}{4\pi r^3} \cdot 
      \Big[ f_3(ikr) (\vbhat{r}\times\vbhat{p_0})\Big]
\end{align*}
%====================================================================%
$$ \vb r=|\vb x-\vb x_0|, \qquad r=|\vb r|, \qquad \vbhat{r}=\frac{\vb r}{r},$$
$$ f_1(x)=-1+x-x^2, \qquad f_2(x)=3-3x+x^2, \qquad f_3(x)=x-x^2.$$
%====================================================================%
An alternative way to understand these fields is to think of the point dipole
$\vb p_0$ at $\vb x_0$ as a localized volume current distribution, 
%====================================================================%
\numeq{JFromp0}{\vb J(\vb x) = -i\omega \vb p_0 \delta(\vb x-\vb x_0)}
%====================================================================%
in which case it is easy to compute the fields at $\vb x$ by
convolving with the usual (free-space) dyadic
Green's functions relating currents to fields:
%====================================================================%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
 E_i(\vb x) 
&= 
 \int \Gamma_{ij}\supt{EE}(\vb x, \vb x^\prime) J_j(\vb x^\prime) d\vb x^\prime
\nn
&=-i\omega \Gamma_{ij}\supt{EE}(\vb x, \vb x_0) p_{0j}
\nn
&=(-i\omega)(ikZ_0Z^r) G_{ij}(\vb x, \vb x_0) p_{0j}
\nn
&=+k^2 \cdot \frac{|\vb p_0|}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon^r } \cdot G_{ij}(\vb x, \vb x_0) \hat{p}_{0j}
\\[8pt]
H_i(\vb x) 
 &=
\int \Gamma_{ij}\supt{ME}(\vb x, \vb x^\prime) J_j(\vb x^\prime) d\vb x^\prime
\nn
&=-i\omega \Gamma_{ij}\supt{ME}(\vb x, \vb x_0) p_{0j}
\nn
&=(-i\omega)(-ik)  C_{ij}(\vb x, \vb x_0) p_{0j}
\nn
&=-\frac{k^2}{Z_0 Z^r} 
   \cdot 
   \frac{|\vb p|}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon^r}
   \cdot C_{ij}(\vb x, \vb x_0) \hat{p}_{0j}
\end{align}
\label{DipoleFieldsFromGC}
\end{subequations}
%====================================================================%
where the $\vb G$ and $\vb C$ dyadics are related to the
scalar Helmholtz Green's function according to
%====================================================================%
\numeq{GCFromG0}
{
  G_{ij}(\vb r)
   = \Big[ \delta_{ij} +\frac{1}{k^2} \partial_i \partial_j \Big] G_0(\vb r),
\qquad
   C_{ij}(\vb r)
   = \frac{1}{ik}\varepsilon_{ijk} \partial_k G_0(\vb r).
}
%====================================================================%
Note that the $\vb E$ and $\vb H$ fields due to an electric 
current distribution $\vb J$ are
%====================================================================%
\numeq{EHFromGC}
{ \vb E(\vb x)=ik Z_0 \int \vb G(\vb x-\vb x^\prime) \cdot \vb J(\vb x^\prime),
  \qquad
  \vb H(\vb x)=-ik \int \vb C(\vb x-\vb x^\prime) \cdot \vb J(\vb x^\prime).
}
%====================================================================%
   

\subsection*{Fields of a phased array of point dipoles, take 1}

Now consider the fields of a phased array of electric dipoles
of dipole moment $\vb p_0$ located at $\vb x_0$ in the lattice 
unit cell.
A first way to get the fields of this array is 
to start with equations (\ref{DipoleFieldsFromGC}) and
(\ref{GCFromG0}), but replace the non-periodic scalar
Green's function $G_0$ with its Bloch-periodic version,
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
$$ G_0(\vb x-\vb x^\prime) \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad 
   \overline{G_0}(\vb x, \vb x^\prime; \vb k\subt{B}) \equiv
   \sum_{\vb L} e^{i \vb k\subt{B} \cdot \vb L} \, G_0(\vb x- \vb x^\prime-\vb L).
$$
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Then the components of the fields of an electric dipole array, 
equation (\ref{EHEDA}), read
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
 E_i\supt{EDA}(\vb x)
 &=k^2 \cdot \frac{|\vb p_0|}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon^r } 
    \left[ \delta_{ij} + \frac{1}{k^2}\partial_i \partial_j
    \right] \overline{G}_{0}(\vb x-\vb x^\prime)\hat{p}_{0j}
\\
 H_i\supt{EDA}(\vb x)
 &=\frac{ik}{Z_0 Z^r}
    \cdot \frac{|\vb p_0|}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon^r } \cdot
    \epsilon_{ijk} \partial_k \overline{G}_{0}(\vb x-\vb x^\prime)
    \hat{p}_{0j}.
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection*{Fields of a phased array of point dipoles, take 2}

An alternative way to get the fields of a point array of dipoles,
which is useful for the half-space calculation of the following
section, is to start with the two-dimensional Fourier representation 
of the (non-periodic) homogeneous dyadic Green's functions.
These follow from the two-dimensional Fourier representation of 
of the non-periodic scalar Green's function:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
$$ G_0(\vb r)=\frac{e^{ik_0 |\vb r|}}{4\pi |\vb r|}
   =
   \frac{i\pi}{2}
   \int_{\mathbb R^2} \frac{d^2 \vb k}{(2\pi)^2}
    \frac{e^{i(k_x x + k_y y + ik_z|z|)}}{k_z},
   \qquad
   k_z\equiv \sqrt{k_0^2 - k_x^2 - k_y^2}
$$
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Applying (\ref{GCFromG0}), 
we obtain the 2D Fourier expansion of the dyadic Green's functions:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\numeq{GCInfiniteKIntegrals}
{
\vb G(\vbrho, z)
 = \int_{\mathbb{R}^2}
     \frac{d\vb k}{(2\pi)^2} \vb g(\vbrho, z; \vb k),
\qquad
\vb C(\vbrho, z)
 = \int_{\mathbb{R}^2}
     \frac{d\vb k}{(2\pi)^2} \vb c(\vbrho, z; \vb k),
}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\vb g(\vbrho, z; \vb k)
&= \pf{i\pi}{2k_0^2 k_z}
   \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
    k_0^2-k_x^2      & -k_x k_y     & \mp k_z k_x \\
    -k_y k_x         & k_0^2-k_y^2  & \mp k_z k_y \\
    \mp  k_x k_z     & \mp k_y k_z  & k_0^2-k_z^2
    \end{array}\right) e^{i\vb k \cdot \vbrho} e^{i k_z |z|}
\\[5pt]
\vb c(\vbrho, z; \vb k)
 &= \pf{i \pi}{2k_0 k_z}
     \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
         0 & \pm k_z & -k_y \\
  \mp k_z  & 0       &  k_x \\
      k_y  & -k_x    &  0 
     \end{array}\right) e^{i\vb k \cdot \vbrho} e^{i k_z |z|}
\end{align}
\label{gc}
\end{subequations}
%====================================================================%
where the $\pm$ sign is $\text{sign}(z).$
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Now reinterpret the infinite integrals over the entire $k_x, k_y$ plane in
(\ref{GCInfiniteKIntegrals}) as finite integrals over just the Brillouin
zone;
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\numeq{GCFiniteKIntegrals}
{
\vb G(\vbrho, z)
 = \int_0^{\Gamma_x} \, dk_x \, \int_0^{\Gamma_y} \, dk_y \,
     \frac{d\vb k}{(2\pi)^2} \overline{\vb g}(\vbrho, z; \vb k),
\qquad
\vb C(\vbrho, z)
 = \int_0^{\Gamma_x} \, dk_x \, \int_0^{\Gamma_y} \, dk_y \,
     \frac{d\vb k}{(2\pi)^2} \overline{\vb c}(\vbrho, z; \vb k),
}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
 \overline{\vb g}(\vbrho, z; k_x, k_y)
 &= \sum_{n_x, n_y=-\infty}^{\infty}
     \vb g\Big(\vbrho, z; k_x + n_x\vbGamma_x, k_y + n_y \vbGamma_y\Big), 
\\
 \overline{\vb c}(\vbrho, z; k_x, k_y) 
 &= \sum_{n_x, n_y=-\infty}^{\infty}
     \vb c\Big(\vbrho, z; k_x + n_x\vbGamma_x, k_y + n_y \vbGamma_y\Big).
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
If I think of (\ref{GCFiniteKIntegrals}) as equations of the form
(\ref{BZIntegration}), i.e. equations relating non-barred quantities
to Brillouin-zone integrals over barred quantities, I can
identify the Bloch-periodic versions of the dyadic Green's functions
as 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
$$
\overline{\vb G}\Big(\vbrho, z; \vb k\supt{B}\Big)
=\frac{\mc V\supt{BZ}}{(2\pi)^2}
  \overline{\vb g}\big(\vbrho, z; \vb k\supt{B}\big), 
\qquad
\overline{\vb C}\Big(\vbrho, z; \vb k\supt{B}\Big)
=\frac{\mc V\supt{BZ}}{(2\pi)^2}
  \overline{\vb c}\big(\vbrho, z; \vb k\supt{B}\big).
$$

For testing purposes it is useful to have analytical expressions
for the dyadic Green's functions above an infinite half space.
These are obtained via a two-step process:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item First we express the fields of a point source above a 
       dielectric half-space as a superposition of plane waves;
       in particular, the fields impinging upon the half-space
       are a linear combination of downward-traveling plane waves.
 \item Then we reason that each individual plane wave is
       reflected from the interface with the usual Fresnel 
       reflection coefficient, and thus the scattered field
       is just the same superposition of plane waves with which
       we began, except that \textbf{(1)} now the plane waves
       are traveling \textit{upward}, and \textbf{(2)} each plane
       wave comes multiplied by the Fresnel reflection coefficients    
       for the dielectric interface.
\end{enumerate}

This procedure is worked out in more detail in the following
sections.

%=================================================
%=================================================
%=================================================
\subsection{Plane-wave decomposition of non-periodic point-source fields}

Note: In what follows,
$\vb k=(k_x,k_y)$ is a \textit{two-dimensional} vector and we have
%====================================================================%
$$ k_z \equiv \sqrt{k_0^2 - |\vb k|^2}, 
%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
   \qquad
%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
   \vb k\subt{3D}\equiv
   \left(\begin{array}{c}k_x \\ k_y \\ \pm k_z \end{array}\right), 
%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
   \qquad
%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
   \pm \equiv
   \begin{cases}
     +, \quad & z\ge 0 \\ 
     -, \quad & z<   0
   \end{cases}.
$$
%====================================================================%
For arbitrary $\vb k$ I now define generalized\footnote{These 
are ``generalized'' plane waves in the sense that $k_z$ is 
imaginary for sufficiently large $\vb k$, in which case the 
waves are evanescent.} transverse-electric and
transverse-magnetic plane waves propagating in the direction
of $\vb k\subt{3D}$:
%====================================================================%
$$\begin{array}{ccccccc}
 \vb E^{\pm} \subt{TE}(\vb x; \vb k)
   &\equiv& E_0 \vb P(\vb k) e^{i\vb k \cdot \vbrho \, \pm \, ik_z z},
   &\qquad&
 \vb H^{\pm} \subt{TE}(\vb x; \vb k)
   &\equiv& H_0 \overline{\vb P}(\vb k) e^{i\vb k \cdot \vbrho \, \pm \, ik_z z},

   &\equiv& H_0 \vb P(\vb k) e^{i\vb k \cdot \vbrho \, \pm \, ik_z z},
\end{array}$$
%====================================================================%
$$ E_0 \equiv 1 \text{ volt/$\mu$m}, \qquad H_0\equiv \frac{E_0}{Z_0}.$$
%====================================================================%
where $\vb P$ and $\overline{\vb P}$ are unit-magnitude
polarization vectors with the properties
that \textbf{(1)} both $\vb P$ and $\overline{\vb P}$ are
orthogonal to $\vb k\subt{3D}$, and
\textbf{(2)} $\vb P$ is orthogonal to $\vbhat{z}$ (i.e. ``transverse'').
%====================================================================%
$$ \vb P(\vb k) \equiv
   \frac{1}{|\vb k|}
   \left(\begin{array}{c}-k_y \\ k_x \\ 0 \end{array}\right),
   \qquad
   \overline{\vb P}(\vb k) \equiv
   \frac{1}{k_0}\Big[ \vb k\subt{3D} \times \vb P(\vb k) \Big]

         \end{array}\right)
$$
%====================================================================%
The trick is now to notice that the columns of the $3\times 3$ matrices
in equation (\ref{gc}) may be written as linear combinations of
$\vb P$ and $\overline{\vb P}$. For example, the leftmost column
of the matrix that enters the definition of $\vb g$ is

In these equations, the $\pm$ sign is $+$ for evaluation points

located below the source. In particular, assuming the 
source lies in the \textit{upper} half-space ($z_0>0$), 
the fields impinging on a dielectric interface at $z=0$
involve the $-$ sign.

\subsection{Plane-wave decomposition of non-periodic DGFs}

The point of the above decomposition is that each
plane wave is reflected from a dielectric interface
at $z=0$ with the usual Fresnel reflection coefficients
$r\supt{TE,TM}(\vb k)$, and thus the scattered fields 
(evaluated at the location of the source point)
due to an $x-,y-,$ or $z$-directed dipole at height
$z_0$ are 
%====================================================================%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}

%====================================================================%
$$ r\subt{TE}(\vb k)= 
   \frac{ \sqrt{k_0^2 - \vb k^2} - \sqrt{\epsilon k_0^2 - \vb k^2}}
        { \sqrt{k_0^2 - \vb k^2} + \sqrt{\epsilon k_0^2 - \vb k^2}},
  \qquad
   r\subt{TM}(\vb k)=

        { \epsilon \sqrt{k_0^2 - \vb k^2} + \sqrt{\epsilon k_0^2 - \vb k^2}}.
$$
%====================================================================%
Note that the $\vb E\subt{TE,TM}$ here involve the $+$
sign, since the reflected waves are upward-traveling; 
but the $C$ coefficients involve the $-$ sign, because
these were the coefficients of the original downward-traveling
plane waves that impinged on the interface.

\subsection{Plane-wave decomposition of periodic DGFs}

To obtain expressions for the incident and scattered
fields of a Bloch-phased \textit{array} of point sources,
we first rewrite expressions (\ref{IncidentFieldsPWD})
and (\ref{ScatteredFieldsPWD}) for the non-periodic
incident and scattered fields as integrals over the 
Brillouin zone. For example, the fields of a (non-periodic)
$\vb x$-directed source at $\vb x_0=z_0\vbhat{z}$ are
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
 &\hspace{-0.6in}
\vb E\supt{ED}\Big(\vb x; \big\{ z_0 \vbhat{z}, \vbhat{x} \big\}\Big)
\\
 &= \pf{p_0}{\epsilon_0 E_0}
    \int\subt{BZ} \frac{d \vb k\subt{B}}{(2\pi)^2} 
    \sum_{\vbGamma}
    \bigg\{ C^{x}\subt{TE}(\vb k\subt{B} + \vbGamma)
	    \vb E^\pm\subt{TE}\Big(\vb x-z_0\vbhat{z}; \vb k\subt{B}+\vbGamma\Big)
\\
&\hspace{1.8in} + 
           C^{x;\pm}\subt{TM}(\vb k+\vbGamma)
	   \vb E^\pm\subt{TM}\Big(\vb x-z_0\vbhat{z}; \vb k\subt{B}+\vbGamma\Big)
   \bigg\}
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
and the corresponding scattered fields evaluated at the location
of the dipole are
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
 &\hspace{-0.1in}
\vb E\sups{scat}
\\
 &= \pf{p_0}{\epsilon_0 E_0}
    \int\subt{BZ} \frac{d \vb k\subt{B}}{(2\pi)^2} 
    \sum_{\vbGamma}
    \bigg\{ r\subt{TE}(\vb k\subt{B} + \vbGamma)
            C^{x}\subt{TE}(\vb k\subt{B} + \vbGamma)
	    \vb E^+\subt{TE}\Big(2z_0\vbhat{z}; \vb k\subt{B}+\vbGamma\Big)
\\
&\hspace{1.8in} + 
            r\subt{TM}(\vb k\subt{B} + \vbGamma)
           C^{x;-}\subt{TM}(\vb k+\vbGamma)
	   \vb E^+\subt{TM}\Big(2z_0\vbhat{z}; \vb k\subt{B}+\vbGamma\Big).
   \bigg\}
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Here $k\subt{B}$ lives in the Brillouin zone---it is a Bloch vector---and
the sum is over all reciprocal lattice vectors $\vbGamma$.

\section{Rewriting infinite 2D $\vb k$-integrals as Brillouin-zone integrals}
\label{RewritingAppendix}

One frequently encounters quantities expressed as infinite 
$\vb k-$space integrals, i.e. integrals over a two-dimensional
wavevector $\vb k$ that ranges over all of $\mathbb{R}_2$:
%====================================================================%
$$ I = \int_{\mathbb{R}^2} \frac{d^2 \vb k}{(2\pi)^2} Q(\vb k). $$
%====================================================================%
Examples include equations (\ref{GCInfiniteKIntegrals}) and 
To rewrite such integrals in a form 
that facilitates comparison with {\sc scuff-ldos} calculations,
it is convenient to recast such integrals as Brillouin-zone
integrations:
%====================================================================%
\begin{align*}
 I &= \int\subt{BZ} \frac{d^2 \vb k}{(2\pi)^2} \overline{Q}(\vb k),
\intertext{where $\overline{Q}(\vb k)$ is the sum of the integrand
function $Q(\vb k)$ evaluated at $\vb k$ and all images of $\vb k$
under translation by reciprocal-lattice vectors}
\overline{Q}(\vb x)&=
\sum_{n_1=-\infty}^\infty
\sum_{n_2=-\infty}^\infty Q\big (\vb k + n_1\vbGamma_1 + n_2\vbGamma_2\big)
\end{align*}
where $\vbGamma_1, \vbGamma_2$ are a basis for the reciprocal lattice.
(We have here considered the 2D-periodic case, but the 1D-periodic
case is similar).

\section{Test: LDOS above an infinite half-space}

At a height $z$ above an infinite dielectric half-space
with relative permittivity $\epsilon$ (and $\mu=1$)
the enhancement of the electric LDOS may be expressed
as an integral over a dimensionless parameter 
$\kappa$:\footnote{K. Joulain et al.,``Definition and 
measurement of the local density of electromagnetic states
 close to an interface,'' Physical Review B \textbf{68} 245405 (2003)}
%====================================================================%
\numeq{JoulainLDOS}
{
 \frac{\rho\supt{E}(z; \omega)}{\rho_0(\omega)}
  =\frac{1}{4}\int_0^\infty \kappa F(\kappa) \, d\kappa,

           + \Big(2\kappa^2-1\Big) \text{Re }\Big( r\subt{TM} e^{2ik_z z}\Big)

    \Big]e^{-2k_z z}, \qquad &\kappa > 1
   \end{cases}
}
%====================================================================%
where 
%====================================================================%
$$ \kappa_z \equiv 
   \begin{cases}
     \sqrt{1-\kappa^2}, \qquad &\kappa < 1, \\
     \sqrt{\kappa^2-1}, \qquad &\kappa > 1, 
   \end{cases}
   \qquad
   \kappa^\prime_z \equiv 
   \begin{cases}
     \sqrt{\epsilon-\kappa^2}, \qquad &\kappa < 1, \\
     \sqrt{\kappa^2-\epsilon}, \qquad &\kappa > 1, 
   \end{cases}
   \qquad
   k_z \equiv k_0\kappa_z,
   \qquad
   k_0 \equiv \frac{\omega}{c},
$$  
%====================================================================%
$$ r\subt{TE} = \frac{\kappa_z - \kappa_z^\prime}{\kappa_z + \kappa_z^\prime}
   \qquad
   r\subt{TM} = \frac{\epsilon \kappa_z - \kappa_z^\prime}{\epsilon \kappa_z + \kappa_z^\prime}
$$
%====================================================================%
The integral in (\ref{JoulainLDOS}) is computing the LDOS as a trace in 
the plane-wave basis; the integral over $\kappa$ is essentially a sum over 
all possible plane-wave wavevectors $\vb k$, and the multiple terms in 
(\ref{JoulainFKappa}) account for the two possible polarizations for each 
wavevector. More specifically, if we think in terms of the usual 
Fresnel-scattering picture of a plane wave incident on a planar interface, 
then $\kappa$ is the sine of the incident angle and $\kappa_z$ is its 
cosine, i.e. the wavevector of the plane wave 
is 
%====================================================================
$$ \vb k = (k_x, k_y, k_z) = k_0(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)
   =k_0(\kappa, 0, \kappa_z)
$$
%====================================================================
and $r\subt{TE}$ and $r\subt{TM}$ are the Fresnel coefficients for reflection
of TE and TM waves from the half-space. 
This interpretation applies to the $0\le \kappa<1$ contribution to 
the integral in (\ref{JoulainLDOS}). 

However, the trace in equation (\ref{JoulainLDOS}) also contains
contributions from modes that cannot be excited by irradiating
the interface from the outside with a plane wave (corresponding
to the $\kappa>1$ portion of the integral). These are 
\textit{evanescent} waves for which the in-plane wavenumber
$k_\parallel=\kappa k_0$ is greater than the free-space wavenumber 
$k_0$. The fields associated with these modes decay exponentially
as we move away from the half-space into the vacuum region.
