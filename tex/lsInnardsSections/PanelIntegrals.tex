\section{Evaluation of 2D Integrals over RWG Basis Functions}

The $\vb E$ and $\vb H$ fields due to an electric current distribution
described by a single unit-strength RWG basis function $\vb f_a(\vb x)$ 
are 
%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
\begin{align}
  \vb E(\vb x) &= ikZ \INP{\vb G(\vb x, \vb x^\prime)}{\vb f_a(\vb x^\prime)}\\
  \vb H(\vb x) &= -ik \INP{\vb C(\vb x, \vb x^\prime)}{\vb f_a(\vb x^\prime)}.
\end{align}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
The fields of a \textit{magnetic} current distribution
described by the same basis function are 
%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
\begin{align}
  \vb E(\vb x) &= +ik \INP{\vb C(\vb x, \vb x^\prime)}{\vb f_a(\vb x^\prime)}\\
  \vb H(\vb x) &= \frac{ik}{Z} \INP{\vb C(\vb x, \vb x^\prime)}{\vb f_a(\vb x^\prime)}.
\end{align}
