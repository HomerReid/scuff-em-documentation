\section{Fields due to individual basis functions}

\subsection*{Reduced potentials}

To compute the electric and magnetic fields at a point $\vb x$ 
arising from the current carried by a single RWG or
half-RWG basis function $\vb f_\alpha(\vb x)$, we first define the
``reduced potentials'' of $\vb f_\alpha$. These are basically just 
the usual vector and scalar potentials due to a current 
distribution, but without the proper dimensionful prefactors:
$$ \vb a_\alpha(\vb x) =
   \int_{\sup \vb f_\alpha} 
     G(k; \vb x - \vb x^\prime) \vb f_\alpha(\vb x^\prime) \, d\vb x^\prime,
   \qquad
   p(\vb x) =
   \int_{\sup \vb f_\alpha} G(k; \vb x - \vb x^\prime) 
                     \Big[\nabla \cdot \vb f_\alpha(\vb x^\prime)\Big] \, d\vb x^\prime.
$$
(Here $G(k; \vb r)=e^{ik|\vb r|}/{(4\pi|\vb r|)}$,
with $k=\sqrt{\epsilon\mu}\cdot \omega$ the wavenumber in the medium 
of interest.)

Now suppose we have electric and magnetic current distributions
described by basis function $\vb f_\alpha$ populated with strengths $K_\alpha$
and $N_\alpha$, respectively. Then the electric and magnetic fields at
$\vb x$ are 
\begin{align*}
 \vb E (\vb x) 
&= 
  Z_0 K_\alpha \Big[ i\omega \mu \vb a_\alpha(\vb x) 
                     - \frac{1}{i\omega \epsilon}\nabla p(\vb x)
               \Big]
 - N_\alpha \nabla \times \vb a(\vb x)
\\[5pt]
 \vb H(\vb x) 
&=
  K_\alpha \nabla \times \vb a(\vb x)
 +\frac{1}{Z_0}
  N_\alpha \Big[   i\omega \epsilon \vb a(\vb x) 
                 - \frac{1}{i\omega \mu }\nabla p(\vb x)
               \Big]
\end{align*}
(Note that $\epsilon$ and $\mu$ here are the \textit{relative}
permeability and permittivity of the medium in question; $Z_0$ 
is the impedance of free space.)
